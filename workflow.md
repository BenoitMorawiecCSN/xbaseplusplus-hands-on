# Workflow, config, and tools

Replicable workspace configuration to quickstart in a proper environment with xbase++ and windows

## Git

### Multiple line commits 

Good practice: 
- first commit line, title
- next lines, commit description

As bellow:
```
commit -m "Commit Title

This is the commit comment
on multiple lines to explain
the goals of the commit"
```

`Shift + Enter` for multiple line commits on windows
